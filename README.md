# DVHA DICOM Editor
Simple DICOM tag editor built with wxPython and PyDICOM

I quickly built this app for a clinical need. I know there are plenty of options out there, but this application 
does not require admin rights - and if using a provided executable, no installation needed.

I will likely merge this code into [DVH Analytics](https://github.com/cutright/DVH-Analytics) so users can edit their DICOM files before importing into the database.

### Run
Clone the code, then call the following in terminal at the project's top-level directory:  
`python app.py`

Or check out the Releases page for an executable.
