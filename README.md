# DVHA DICOM Editor
(Very) Simple DICOM tag editor built with wxPython and PyDICOM

I quickly built this app for a clinical need. I know there are plenty of options out there, but you can 
freeze this app with PyInstaller so users don't need an installation or admin rights.

I will likely merge this code into DVHA so users can edit their DICOM files before importing into the database.

### Run
Clone the code, then call the following in terminal at the project's top-level directory:  
`python app.py`

Or check out the Releases page for an executable.
